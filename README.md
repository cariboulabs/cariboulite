# CaribouLite
CaribouLite is an affordable, educational, open-source SDR evaluation platform and a HAT for the Raspberry-Pi family of boards (40-pin versions only). It is built for makers, hackers, and researchers and was designed to complement the current SDR (Software Defined Radio) eco-systems offering with a scalable, standalone dual-channel software-defined radio.

## NOTE: No Support for RPI-5
Due to the architectural changes in RPI5 - the new I/O controller called "RP1" chip, CaribouLite is not supported on RPI5. We assume that the reason is the removal of the SMI interface altogether from the external interfaces by Broadcomm's team.
So, if you intend to use CaribouLite on RPI5 please don't - it won't work. Why was the SMI interface deprecated by Broadcomm (either from its hardware or kernel SW support)? Most probably due to the same reason this interface was not documented in the first place - no interest in supporting a high-speed external interface within the 40-pin connector.

Edit: The workaround we are working to support RPI5 anyway - trying to utilize the Display and Camera I/O pins from the 40-pin connector to stream information - FPGA + Kernel module adaptation.
Edit2: A unofficial developer (Matteo Serva) is working on supporting the RPI5 by leveraging multiple SPI interfaces

# Getting Started & Installation
Use the following steps to install the CaribouLite on your choice of RPI board
1. Mount the CaribouLite on a **un-powered** RPI device using the 40-pin header.
2. Power the RPI device, wait for it to finish boot sequence.
3. Clone this repository into a local directory of your choise (in this case `~/projects`)
```
mkdir ~/projects
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/cariboulabs/cariboulite
cd cariboulite
```
4. Use the following setup command (**note: don't `sudo` it**):
    ```
    install.sh
    ```

The setup script **requires internet connection** and it follows the following automatic steps:
1. **Dependencies** installation (apt)
2. **Soapy API tools installation** (SoapySDR and SoapyRemote) - only if they are not currently present in the system. Installation from code.
3. **Internal dependencies installation**
   1. Utilities and tools
   2. IIR DSP library
   3. SMI stream device module (kernel object) blob generation
4. **Main software** and SoapyAPI compilation and installation
5. **Raspberry PI configuration** verification. Note - the installer doesn't not actively change the RPI's configuration to fit to CaribouLite. It just checks the `/boot/config.txt` configuration file and raises warning when problem is detected. Then the user shall need to adjust the parameters accordingly.

Note: the user will be requested to enter their password during the installation process.

## Installation Troubleshooting
1. **Modules**: Both the `spi` and `arm-i2c` dtoverlays should be disabled to run CaribouLite properly. The `libcariboulite` doen't use them. It uses direct access to `/dev/mem` to expose these peripherals (through the `pigpio` library).
The interfaces can be disabled (or enabled back whenever needed) by either directly editing the `/dev/config.txt` file or by using the `sudo raspi-config` command. The latter is the preferred choice as it is straight forward, less error prone and it works on all RaspberryPi's OS distributions (including DragonOS).
If the direct editing path has been chosen (`/boot/config.txt`), the following lines
should be commented out:
`#dtparam=spi=on`
`#dtparam=i2c_arm=on`

2. **Kernel headers** - `libcariboulite` loads a custom kernel module (`smi_stream_dev`) during startup. The kernel module sources are location in : **`/software/libcariboulite/caribou_smi/kernel`**. Recompilation of these .ko obejcts is needed whenever software is pulled. This requires currently to have the local host system to have the kernel headers installed. In addition, upgrading the kernel will require recompilation with the updated kernel headers. Once the `smi_stream_dev` is listed inside the main kernel tree, this process will become redundant.

3. **sudo**ing - Currently hardware is accessed through the PIGPIO library. It should be given a root access to control the low level interfaces through the `/dev/mem` device. The relevant part of the software that is concerned in this matter is the "io_utils" sub-module. Once this module is re-designed to access the hardware through the "gpiomem" and "spidev" modules, this restrictions shall be mitigated (by the definitions of `udev` rules).
So currently, sudo'ing is needed whenever CaribouLite is accessed (including sudo'ing python...).

# Transmitting a signal

There is an experimental feature for transmitting arbitrary waveforms.
The guide on how to use this version is [here](/docs/notes/tutorial.md)

# SMI Interface

Unlike many other HAT projects, CaribouLite utilizes the **SMI** (Secondary Memory Interface) present on all the 40-pin RPI versions. This interface is not thoroughly documented by both Raspberry-Pi documentation and Broadcomm's reference manuals. An amazing work done by [Lean2](https://iosoft.blog/2020/07/16/raspberry-pi-smi/) (code in [git repo](https://github.com/jbentham/rpi)) in hacking this interface has contributed to CaribouLite's technical feasibility. A deeper overview of the interface is provided by G.J. Van Loo, 2017 [Secondary_Memory_Interface.pdf](docs/smi/Secondary%20Memory%20Interface.pdf). The SMI interface allows exchanging up to ~500 Mbit/s (depending on the FPGA, data-bus width, etc.) between the RPI and the HAT, and yet, the results vary between the different versions of RPI. The results further depend on the specific RPI version's DMA speeds.

The SMI interface can be accessed from the user space Linux applications as shown in [Lean2](https://iosoft.blog/2020/07/16/raspberry-pi-smi/), but Broadcomm also provided a neat minimal charachter device interface in the `/dev` directory using the `open`, `close`, `write`, `read`, and `ioctl` system calls. More on this interesting interface in the [designated readme file](software/libcariboulite/src/caribou_smi/index.md). This device driver needs to be loaded using `modprobe`.

More information on this interface can be found [here (HW side)](docs/smi/README.md) and [here (SW side)](software/libcariboulite/src/caribou_smi/README.md).

# Hardware Revisions
The board first prototyping (**Red**) revision ([REV1](hardware/rev1)) has been produced and tested to meet our vision on the board's capabilities. This revision was used to test its RF parts, the digital parts, and to develop its firmware and software support over the RPI.

The second revision ([REV2](hardware/rev2)) - **White** - was then designed to further refine the design as described below:
1. Image rejection filtering improvement - U10 and U12 (HPF & LPF) - have been replaced by integrated LTCC filters by MiniCircuits with much better out-of-band rejection than the former ones.
2. Removing FPGA flash - redundant given the fact that the the RPI configures the FPGA in <1sec over SPI. Even if we have a whole library of custom made FPGA firmware files, switching between them is as simple and fast as a single linux command.
3. Board layout improvements and overlays (silkscreen) beautification (including logo).
4. A single system level 3.3V power (while the FPGA still receives 2.5V and 1.2V for its core). A linear regulator (rather than a switching DC-DC) was used to reduce conducted (power and ground) noise levels.
5. Top and bottom EMI sheilding option - the EMI/RFI shield design models are provided in the [3d directory](hardware/rev2/3d/)
6. More detailed changes in the [schematics](hardware/rev2/schematics/cariboulite_r2_sch.PDF).

In summary, in CaribouLite-Rev2.5 PCB design has been thoroughly re-thought to meet its educational needs with performance in mind. The RF path has been annotated with icons to ease the orientation in the schematics sheets, friendly silk writing was added describing system's components by their functionality rather than logical descriptors, and more.
